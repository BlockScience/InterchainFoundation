# Alpha Bonds: Risk-Adjusted Bonding Curves
## Ethical FinTech for Social Impact
<br>

This research project explores the formalized design of cryptoeconomic mechanisms to be used in a novel impact bond, called **Alpha Bonds**. This tool **composes bonding curve + prediction market functionality to improve risk assessment** for funding outcome-based social impact projects.

The outcome of this initiative is a digital twin cadCAD model, which can inform the implementation of this new impact bond primitive as part of the Cosmos SDK. We believe it will provide great value within the Sustainability Hub and beyond.


## Implementation Partners

# What are Alpha Bonds?

![img](https://i.imgur.com/YS3g0tS.png)

Alpha bonds are a new form of dynamically priced impact bond, that automatically adjusts to risk information via a built-in prediction mechanism.

A typical social impact bond (SIB) has a lifecycle that looks like this:
![img](https://i.imgur.com/2GDPwZ2.png)

The problem with traditional SIBs (and their cousins, Development Impact Bonds) is the lack of transparency of the risk involved in a given project. This deters investors, increases the costs of borrowing funds, and raises the barrier to successful impact interventions. 

Alpha bonds are generated by risk-adjusted bonding curves, which are dynamic curves that adapt their shape according to a prediction mechanism coefficient $alpha$. This gives transparent risk data to investors and decision makers, allowing for more aligned decision making and accurate risk pricing on impact investments. 
<br><br>
## The Benefits of Alpha Bonds

* **For impact projects:** Align participant incentives through collaborative investment & shared benefits
* **For funding bodies & decision makers:** Access real-time risk probability inherent in a given impact project
* **For communities:** Empower local investment in local challenges through simplified impact financing tools

The benefits of alpha bonds are manyfold. Impact initiatives can use alpha bonds to **align participant incentives and simultaneously earn continuous funding** by allowing communities and beneficiaries to purchase tokens from the bonding curve, thus co-investing in the success of the project. Meanwhile, funding groups or decision makers further afield are provided with a **real-time risk signal** through the prediction mechanism. 

Further benefits of alpha bonds lie in **reducing barriers to funding impact projects**, and also in reducing their necessary scale. Through replicable processes and tools (such as this digital twin model), outcomes-based impact projects can be unitized and operate on much smaller scales, avoiding the difficultiess of "too big to fail" projects and their overhead.

## Alpha Bond Details

Read more about our [methodology & first use case](Paper/0_ProblemStatementandMethodology.md), the [lifecycle stages of an Alpha Bond](Paper/2_BondLifecyclePhases.md) and [what agent roles are involved](Paper/1_EcosystemRoles.md) in our Phase 1 documentation. This [article on risk-adjusted bonding curves](https://medium.com/ixo-blog/risk-adjusted-token-bonding-curves-eb4fffc86bf0) also provides some high-level context for this new impact bond tool, and our [Engineering Requirements notebook dives into technical detail](Paper/3_EngineeringRequirements.ipynb).

Alpha bonds are composed of four mechanisms: two bonding curve mechanisms (mint & burn), and two prediction mechanisms (predict success & failure), with mechanisms as seen below.

As mentioned in the slides above, agents may choose to participate in just the bonding curve, or the bonding curve and the prediction market. Note that once tokens are attested towards project success or failure, they cannot be unattested and cast again, although an agent may attest both positively and negatively with subsequent actions.

The diagram below demonstrates how the alpha coefficient is updated through agent attestations in the prediction mechanism.

The prediction market avoids the Keynesian Beauty Contest problem (also called "vote memeing", or voting with the crowd) through the **'Heavy Underdog' property**, which is the same reason you might bet on a severely outmatched team in the playoffs if you think they are going to win - because the payout is worth it to vote accurately according to your belief. With a bonding curve as your bookie, the odds are updated with each transaction - **making these tools essentially [estimators](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7433/1/zargham_paruch_shorish.pdf) of collective sentiment.**
<br><br>

## Alpha Bond Settlement & Payout

When a project comes to a close (in either success or failure), the alpha bond resolves to its settlement phase. Payouts from the alpha bond system vary depending on project completion. 

### Case 1: Project Success

When a project is completed successfully, the Outcomes Payer provides a lump sum of $C$ dollars to the bonding curve reserve.

The reserve is then split up and paid out according to the proportion of bonding curve tokens that have not been entered into the prediction mechanism ($sfree$) and tokens cast towards predicting project success ($s1$) as a fraction of total token supply ($S$).


### Case 2: Project Failure

When a project fails, the Outcomes Payer provides no additional funding.

The reserve is then split up and paid out according to the proportion of bonding curve tokens that have not been entered into the prediction mechanism ($sfree$) and tokens cast towards predicting project failure ($s0$) as a fraction of total token supply ($S$).

Note that the lump sum ($C$) offered by the **Outcomes Payer** on project completion provides **incentive for participants to collude towards project success**.

Full mathematical derivations of settlement conditions can be found in the [Alpha Update notebook](Math_Specification/3_AlphaUpdate.ipynb) produced in Phase 2 of this research initiative.

## Scope of Research Initiative
Our goal is to gather requirements, formally specify, document, design, and test an Impact Bond Mechanism to fund outcome driven projects. The Bonds life cycle will account for the (i) pre-conditions and execution of bond initialization, (ii) a set of mechanisms available to participants for continuous funding and attestation regarding project status, and (iii) a close-out plus reconcilation mechanism that accounts for a final verdict on the success of the project, as well as the post-conditions for the system, e.g. impact tokens representing the participation level in a successful project. This design is for a parameterized class of bond mechanisms which may be configured to fit a wide range of circumstances.  In this instance, the digital twin model underlies a Cosmos SDK Implemnentation, upon which ixo is building an instance of an alpha bond risk-adjusted bonding curve, as shown below.

## Methods and Tools
System Requirements and Functional Requirements will be mapped to formally frame the inherently human challenge into a bounded dynamic Mechanism Design problem. The framework for Discrete Event Games as described in [Economic Games as Estimators](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7433/1/zargham_paruch_shorish.pdf) will be applied. The Impact Bonds will be more advanced variations of Bonding Curves, see [From Curved Bonding to Configuration Spaces](https://epub.wu.ac.at/7385/1/zargham_shorish_paruch.pdf). While initial designs will be analytical in nature, the computer aided design process is iterative. The [cadCAD](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD) modeling software will be applied to develop a computational model of the mechanisms by following [cadCAD best practices](https://github.com/cadCAD-org/cadCAD/tree/master/documentation). The model will be used for failure mode analysis, sensitivity analysis and other design validation procedures prior to implementation.

## Why Model Systems in cadCAD?

In cyber-physical systems like international power grids, global flight networks, or socioeconomic community ecosystems, engineers model **simulated replicas of their system**, called **digital twins**. These models help to manage the complexity of systems that have trillions of data points and are constantly in flux. These simulations channel the information into pathways that allow humans to understand what is going on in their ecosystem at a high level, so they can intervene where and as appropriate. (Like hitting a breaker switch when a fault is cleared in a power system).

![img](https://i.imgur.com/vREp8ts.png)

Digital twins can be considered like a flight simulator, which can be used to run your system through a billion different "tests", varying one parameter at a time, to see what effects may throw your system out of balance. As engineers with public safety in mind, we must understand the tipping points of our systems, and ensure mechanisms are in place to push the system back towards balance if and when they enter their boundary conditions of safety.

## What is cadCAD?
cadCAD (complex adaptive dynamics Computer-Aided Design) is a python based modeling framework for research, validation, and Computer Aided Design of complex systems. Given a model of a complex system, cadCAD can simulate the impact that a set of actions might have on it. This helps users make informed, rigorously tested decisions on how best to modify or interact with the system in order to achieve their goals. cadCAD supports different system modeling approaches and can be easily integrated with common empirical data science workflows. Monte Carlo methods, A/B testing and parameter sweeping features are natively supported and optimized for.
