    "The Reserve $R \\in \\mathbb{R}_{++}$ is defined as the total amount of bond tokens bonded as reserve funds under the bonding curve.\n",

    "##### Supply\n",
    "The Supply $S \\in \\mathbb{R}_{++}$ is defined as the total amount of impact tokens issued by the bonding curve contract.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Bonding Curve Curvature\n",
    "The state variable $\\kappa$ describes the curvature of the bonding curve.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Reserve Ratio\n",
    "The Reserve Ratio $\\rho \\in [0, 1]$ is determined by the bonding curve's curvature $\\kappa$, and is given by $$ \\rho = 1/\\kappa$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Price\n",
    "The Price $P$ is the price of a bond token and is dependent on the slope of the bonding curve, given by $$P = \\kappa * \\frac{R}{S}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "As $\\rho = \\frac{1}{\\kappa}$, we have $$P = \\frac{R}{\\rho \\cdot S}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Alpha\n",
    "The Alpha $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ at time $t$ is the system's conjecture of the likelihood of success of the bond, represented normalized such that $\\alpha = 0$ indicates that the project is estimated to fail, and $\\alpha = 1$ indicates the highest likelhood of success. \n",
    "\n",
    "We consider $\\alpha \\in [0,1]$ to be an estimator of $\\Omega$ that is learned from the Attestation Mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Claim on Conditioned Payout\n",
    "The state variable $Q \\in \\mathbb{R}_{+}$ is defined as the number of claims on payouts conditioned on an attestation, which is either an attestation that $\\Omega=0$ for $Q_{\\Omega=0}$ claims, or that $\\Omega=0$ for $Q_{\\Omega=0}$ claims."
