    "# Bond Lifecycle Phases\n",
    "With an understanding of all of the ecosystem roles, it is next important to understand each of the phases in the bond lifecycle. Within each phase are a different set of rules and allowable actions that agents can take. There are also certain conditions that must be met in order to move from one phase to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, here we will provide general descriptions of the phases in order to provide the full context of the activities that occur in the ecosystem, however the Inputs and Next State Outputs are only intended to define the specific system inputs and outputs that affect the bonding curve system state.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a technical perspective, the bonding curve system can be described as a finite state machine, with multiple finite phases or states, inputs and outputs in and out of each state, and state transitions from one state to another in response to an input.\n",
    "\n",

    "## Phase 0: Pre-initialization \n",
    "The pre-initialization phase is meant to represent all of the activities that occur prior to launch of the bond. This includes all of the prior planning and setup. It includes agreements, expectations, obligations, decisions around bond parameters, initial conditions, payment conditions, roles and rights of stakeholders, et al. During the pre-initialization phase, the bond is set up with an associated wallet and repository and all bond participants are identified with digital IDs, public keys, and credentials. All investments including funding as well as resources, materials, and equipment are agreed upon. At the end of this phase, the bond should be for all intents and purposes ready to launch.\n",

    "All planning and setup completed and with the bond Ready to Launch will move the system from the Pre-initialization Phase into the Initialization Phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 1: Initialization\n",
    "During the Initialization Phase, the bond is launched. All of the parameters, roles and rights, thresholds, conditions, etc. are set. All funds as agreed upon are deposited into appropriate accounts. Funds are divided with a portion of funds going into the Project Operating Funds for use on the project and a portion going into the Reserve Funds to provide liquidity to the bonding curve. Initialization is essentially the instantiation of everything that was agreed upon in pre-initialization.\n",

If the funding threshold is not met, the system will move from the Initialization Phase to the Settlement Phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Phase 2: Execution\n",
    "The execution phase is the phase where active bond trading occurs resulting in updates to the reserve, supply, available project operating funds, and price.
